### Building a 3-Tier Architecture for in AWS using Terraform
In this project, we will build a the architecture for a web app in AWS.


The main.tf files contains almost all the configuration needed to provision the infrastructure.


To kick if off, add or export your AWS CLI credentials and run the following commands from your terminal


terraform init


terraform plan --var-file=testing.tfvars


terraform apply --var-file=testing.tfvar



### Here are some important security measures that you should consider implementing:

#1. strong passwords and authentication:
Enforce the use of strong, complex passwords.
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an added layer of security.

#2. Regular Software Updates and Patch Management:
Keep operating systems, applications, and software up to date to address known vulnerabilities.
Implement a patch management process to ensure timely application of security patches.

#3.Firewalls and Network Security:
Use firewalls to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to detect and mitigate network attacks.

#4.Data Encryption:
Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit using encryption algorithms.
Use secure protocols like HTTPS for transmitting data over networks.

#5.Access Control and Least Privilege:
Grant users only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks (principle of least privilege).
Regularly review and revoke unnecessary access privileges.

#6. User Training and Awareness:
Educate users about security best practices, such as recognizing phishing attempts and avoiding suspicious links.
Conduct regular security awareness training sessions.

#7.Backup and Disaster Recovery:
Regularly back up critical data and systems to prevent data loss in case of a breach or system failure.
Test and maintain a disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity.

#8.Vulnerability Management:
 Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
Prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities based on their severity.

#9. Endpoint Security:
Use antivirus and anti-malware software on all endpoints.

#10. Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for advanced threat detection and mitigation.Secure Development Practices:
Follow secure coding practices during software development to prevent common vulnerabilities.
Conduct regular code reviews and security assessments.

#11. Physical Security:
Restrict physical access to servers, data centers, and other critical infrastructure.
Implement measures such as access cards, biometric authentication, and surveillance systems.
